# Hive OS PXE Diskless
Network boot for diskless BC-250 Rigs

This is just a temperorary fix while HiveOs gets off their asses, check if they've fixed.

This is a modified version of the Hiveos Pxe diskless to work with BC-250 Mining cards. 
The opencl version in hiveramfs says its 21.40.1 but its actually version 22.20 with rocm and fully is compatiable with the BC-250. 

Before you start, it took me a bit of time to figure this out, no thanks to the hive devs so iâ€™d be much appreciate if you donated a little wart. (I did save you a lot in nvmeâ€™s ðŸ™‚)

Thanks, James. 

Copy the install link below 
Then build the Ubuntu18 with ./deploy_pxe ubuntu18 --build (it will take awhile)
then re run ./pxe_setup.sh

Other Notes

Do not use ./deploy_pxe ubuntu18 --upgrade it will break the permissions on the BC-250 Rig. 

In BC-250 Bios change network boot to enable and Ipv4 PXE (Http isnt used do not enable)
In bios you can enable SVM if needed (but does not make a difference) but do not enable IOMMU it will not work.

Thank you Rick_IV for clarifing the install!
"First you have to use the chroot command:
sudo ./deploy_pxe ubuntu18 --chroot

Once there, check to see if DNS is working by pinging google.com. If you get an IP you're good. If not, the resolv.conf file is symlinked and most likely missing. Run the following to add the correct resolv.conf:

mkdir /run/resolvconf && touch /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf && echo 'nameserver 8.8.4.4' > /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf

Now you should be able to ping google and get an ip. Next, cd into /hive/sbin and run this:

./amd-ocl-install 22.02

Then it might be a good idea to install any miners that you would want to have as part of the default install. Once finished in chroot, type exit and run intrd then the original deploy build command again:

sudo ./deploy_pxe ubuntu18 --initrd
sudo ./deploy_pxe ubuntu18 --build

I had to stop the inet-utils service and restart atfpt service to get it to serve the OS."
